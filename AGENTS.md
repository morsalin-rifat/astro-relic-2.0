# Architecture decisions

- The Astro Relic game (three.js + `src/game`, `src/state`, `src/data`, `src/components/Overlays|SolarHUD`) touches browser APIs at module load (localStorage in the store, WebGL). Keep it behind the lazy client-only mount in `src/routes/index.tsx` / `src/components/game/Game.tsx`; never import `src/game/*` or `src/state/store` from an SSR-evaluated module.
- Migrated from https://github.com/morsalin-rifat/astro-relic.git (Vite SPA, source of truth for behavior); game assets live in `public/images/` (referenced by absolute URL, not imports).
